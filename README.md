## Plot

All beliefs, regardless of their empirical foundations, can be real with
regards to their consequences. Conspiracy theories convinced most of the world
and true conspiracies were built to fight them. Most governments were
overthrown. Terrorists and armies devastated cities all over the globe. A
global pandemic of viruses developed to be used as biological weapons now
ravages the world. The infected die quickly, but their bodies live on to spread
the disease. The deceased are not to be mourned but feared and fought.

## Art Style

We are creating a top down shooter and therefore the enjoyability in our game
comes mostly from the core functionality rather than the graphics. With this in
mind and taking into account the time scale, we chose to go with a low
poly/cartoony theme.

## Audio


Zombies sound effects have a significant impact on the player's immersion, and
currently, we will use the free GDC 2020 Audio Bundle for sound effects in our
game. However, we will explore older releases since there is a release each
year with different sounds.

From a music perspective, we wish to compose our own tracks for an adaptive
music experience if time allows. Adaptive music is defined as music that is
changed base on the game's parameters; for example, the intensity of the music
can increase as more zombies will be seen on the map.

After carefully listening to the soundtracks of the mentioned games, there is
extensive use of synthesizers, soundscapes, drums, strings, and guitars. In
addition, a team member possesses Native-Instrumentsâ€™ Kontakt libraries, which
might be used for the music in the game.
